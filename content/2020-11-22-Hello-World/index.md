me and my friends have been looking for internships for a while now, we're in 3rd year of engineering and many fellow students share this anxiety.

I naturally applied at a number of startups, even cold emailed a few founders with ideas id had for project internships that would go well with their services.

in many ways this is a ridiculing process in others its humbing.
